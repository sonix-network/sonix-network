### ➔ What is an Internet Exchange Point (IXP)?

{{% faq-box %}}
An Internet Exchange Point (IXP) is a physical and virtual infrastructure where different networks, such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs), content providers, and businesses, interconnect to exchange internet traffic directly. 

Instead of routing traffic through multiple intermediary networks, an IXP enables direct interconnection, which offers several key benefits:
- **Improved Performance:** By reducing the distance and number of hops traffic must travel, IXPs lower latency and improve data transfer speeds.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Direct peering between networks reduces reliance on expensive transit providers, significantly lowering costs.
- **Enhanced Reliability:** IXPs often provide a more stable connection, minimizing the risk of outages due to intermediate network failures.
- **Scalability:** IXPs support high-volume traffic exchanges, essential for growing businesses and service providers.

SONIX provides these benefits across multiple locations in Sweden, empowering members with efficient, sustainable, and community-driven connectivity.
