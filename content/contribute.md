# Support SONIX

SONIX depends on your support to keep our services running, expand to new locations, and build a more connected and sustainable internet for everyone. As a non-profit, donations are essential for maintaining our infrastructure and continuing to provide free ports to all our members.

Your contributions help us:
- **Maintain current locations** to ensure reliable and seamless operations.
- **Expand to new areas** to bring connectivity to underserved regions.
- **Invest in technology** to innovate and improve our services.

## Why Your Support Matters

### **Keeping SONIX Running**
Maintaining and expanding our network isn’t possible without donations. Your contributions ensure SONIX remains operational and continues to grow as a reliable and accessible internet exchange.

### **Growing the Network**
Every donation allows us to add capacity at existing locations and set up new facilities, helping us connect more networks and improve internet access across Sweden.

## Current Funding Goals

We need your support to achieve the following goals:

### **Digital Realty Stockholm Patch Panel Expansion – 50,000 SEK**
Our patch panel at Digital Realty Stockholm has reached full capacity. To continue connecting new members, we need to upgrade to a larger panel. This expansion will allow more networks to join SONIX, boosting Sweden’s internet connectivity.

### **Equinix SK2 Hosting – Facility Sponsorship**
We’re looking for sponsors to host SONIX equipment at Equinix SK2. To set up this location, we need:
- **500W of power**
- **4U of rack space**

Adding this facility will enhance our reach in Stockholm and create more opportunities for network growth.

If you or your organization can help with these specific goals, [contact us](/contact/) to discuss further.
